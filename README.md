# MonsterRPG

This C# console application is an exercise in logic and class design that pulls from my nostalgia for old GameBoy Color games to re-create a monster-hunting RPG. Features include a library of unique monsters, a system for leveling up, and a comprehensive battle system which allows for the use of items, monster abilities, and more. Additional features I hope to implement include: Randomly generated maps with chance encounters, a home-base map with written dialogue for NPC's, a system for managing the player's party, and a mechanism for saving progress.
